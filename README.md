## OVERVIEW

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. For example, in Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.

### THE CHALLENGE

Users should be able to:

- Include a simple UI for the children to input and receive conversions between Roman numerals and integers;
- Implement a RomanNumerals helper that conforms to the following API
    RomanNumerals.toRoman(1000); // should return 'M'
    RomanNumerals.fromRoman('M'); // should return 1000
